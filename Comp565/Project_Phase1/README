ABOUT: Project based off the AGMGSKv6. Notes about added models or modified code can be seen below.

-Theme: 
Outer-space, perhaps on the moon. A land composed of mountains, craters, and little green men with top-hats and pipes. 

-Height Generation Algorithm:
The algorithm used to create the terrain. The algorithm works in a series of steps:
createHeightTexture: 1. Every bit of land is raised up by a specified random range. 2. Via the Brownian algorithm, mountains are formed centered around hard-coded pivots. 3. Craters are then added to the map which, unlike the Brownian, have fixed centers. 4. Noise added to the entire map. 5. The area on which the maze rests is flattened out.
createColorTexture: This function relies heavily upon the function heightToVector4 which uses the height map values to determine the appropriate color texture. Becasue the terrain is "outer space moon", the terrain is mainly composed of grays and blacks with no particular order.

-NPAgent Movement Algorithm: (Located in file NPAgent.cs in the update function, line 144)
NPAgent is given a reference to the treasure class which keeps track of all treasures on the map. When 'n' is pressed, the Update function will attempt to find the nearest treasure that isn't tagged. If found, a boolean flag is set which indicates that we are now on treasure path mode. Upon every update we check if the treasure is still untagged, or if we are in range (300 px) to grab it. Once a treasure is grabbed or tagged, the NPAgent will simply flip the boolean and resume its original path.

-Staying On Top Of Ground Algorithm: (Located in file Stage.cs, function "setSurfaceHeight" line 345)
The Lerp method was used in order to stay on top of the terrain. This implementation can be found in Stage, function setSurfaceHeight. Data is first gathered to determin the 4 corners of the square and current position. From there, we determine via the distance algorithm which corner the point is closest to. At this point, the Lerp method is applied and a correct height is found.

-Treasure Locations: (Locations referr to original map coord size of 512 x 512)
x     z

430   400
410   400
420   400
447   453


###################################################################################

STATUS: February 16, 2015 - Fully functional for phase 1 requirements.

###################################################################################

USAGE: Referr to the AGMGSKv6 manual for key functions and other details.

-New Functions:

key n:
Causes the npAgent to go after the nearest treasure. Once the treasure is reached, or if the player reaches it first, the Np agent will continue back on its original waypoint path.

UPDATE LOG: 

February 16, 2015 - After lecture I was able to modify the lerp method. Tested and seems to work good now. (30 min)

February 12-14, 2015 - Updated the terrain generator in accordance with the minor update provided on the ppt slides. New terrain was generated.  Wrote individual classes for my models.. These are given the class name EyeCandy_*, including the rocket and porta-poty. A single cloud now exists which acts as a "mother ship". The dogs have been replaced with alien models. 
                       The lerp method was used in order to fix the y position of moving objects. There are still some errors which I plan on addressing with Professor Barnes. Modifications were made to the player and npAgent classes to include treasure path checks, according to the requirements laid out in the document. Treasure chasing, count, and display has been tested and works. Stage was updated appropriately to include/reflect these changes.  (~20 hours) 

February 10-11, 2015 - A major effort went into studying AGMGSKv6, each file and how it relates to the others. Also, after becoming more familiar with terrain maker, I decided to go back to a moon type based terrain. Using 3ds max I was able to create various models, and by installing a plugin for 3ds I was able to directly export direct x files. It was a bit of a pain to get it to work at first. Direct X runtime and Visual Studio 2008 were installed first in order for the added plugin to work. As part of going over AGMGSKv6, I added a bit of commentary and rearranged some of the code. I still haven't really written any of my own code, but I feel more familiar with the framework and will start to write code next time. (~15 hours)

February 4-5, 2015 - A great deal of study went into understanding the terrain maker better. I decided against a space theme and shifted more towards a highland theme. (I'll probably still set the sky to be a space like view.) The Brownian Algorithm was implimented along with a few structures which make the functions extremely more modular. The algorithm makes use of both diamond and circular shapes.  Both a height and color map were produced, and blurred via Gimp using the Gaussian Blur. (~5 hours)

February 3, 2015 -  Downloaded AGMGSKv6, along with the texturemap creator. Spent a good while looking over the texturemap code. I feel more comfortable with how it works, and will probably attempt to create my own terrain next time. My idea is to have a space-like environment. In order to get the terrainmap program to work I had to add a reference for System.Drawing. (3 hours) 

January 28, 2015 - Examined the program provided by Professor Barnes called "axis". Points of interest include the following: 1. As oppossed to openGL, XNA's matrices are multiplied in reverse order. This is because XNA's matrices are row-majored versus openGL's which are column major. (2 hours)
